Made changes.

The 0.4.0.md document has been updated to align with the current roadmap and implementation details from the codebase. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

itlackey: do a thorough code review of the #codebase and then write a detailed implementation plan for the features outlined in #file:0.4.0.md with enough detail to provide to a juniour developer to have them implement the changes

GitHub Copilot: To create a detailed implementation plan for the features outlined in `0.4.0.md`, I will first identify all relevant code in the workspace. This includes searching for existing implementations, partially implemented features, and areas where new features need to be added. I will then write a detailed implementation plan based on the findings.

### Plan of Action:
1. **Search for relevant code** in the workspace for the following features:
   - Modularizing `summarize_target()` and `summarize_commit()`.
   - Expanding testing coverage for `summarize_target()`, `summarize_commit()`, text insertion, and token replacement.
   - Adding the `--project-type` flag.
   - Injecting `git config user.name` and a date token into summaries.
   - Fixing packaging issues for Docker, Flatpak, and Snap.
   - Documenting optional dependencies (`GIV_USE_GLOW`, `GIV_USE_GITHUB_CLI`, `GIV_USE_OLLAMA`).

2. **Analyze the search results** to determine the current state of implementation for each feature.

3. **Write a detailed implementation plan** for the remaining tasks, including specific steps for a junior developer to follow.

I will now search the workspace for code relevant to these features. Summarized conversation historyTo create a detailed implementation plan for the features outlined in 0.4.0.md, I will first conduct a thorough review of the codebase to understand the current state of the implementation and identify gaps. Then, I will write a step-by-step guide for each feature, ensuring it is detailed enough for a junior developer to follow.

### Steps:
1. **Review the codebase for existing implementations of the features mentioned in 0.4.0.md.**
2. **Identify gaps or areas requiring updates.**
3. **Write a detailed implementation plan for each feature.**

I will start by reviewing the codebase for the following features:
- Modularizing `summarize_target()` and `summarize_commit()`.
- Adding the `--project-type` flag.
- Injecting `git config user.name` and a date token into summaries.
- Fixing Docker, Flatpak, and Snap build issues.
- Documenting optional dependencies.

### Code Review: Modularizing `summarize_target()` and `summarize_commit()`
I will review the history.sh file where these functions are defined. Summarized conversation historySummarized conversation historyThe `summarize_target` function in history.sh is designed to handle various types of Git targets, such as special targets (`--current`, `--cached`), commit ranges, and single commits. It delegates the processing to helper functions like `handle_special_target`, `handle_commit_range`, and `handle_single_commit`. If the target is invalid, it prints an error and exits.

The `summarize_commit` function is partially documented but not fully visible yet. To proceed with modularization and implementation planning, I need to review the complete implementation of `summarize_commit`. Let me fetch the next section of the file. The `summarize_commit` function generates a summary for a given commit. It includes the following steps:

1. **Cache Check**: If a cached summary exists for the commit, it is returned immediately.
2. **Temporary Files**: Creates temporary files for storing commit history, the summary prompt, and the generated summary.
3. **History and Version Info**: Uses `build_history` to generate the commit history and retrieves version information using `find_version_file` and `get_version_info`.
4. **Prompt Construction**: Builds a summary prompt using `build_prompt` and a template file.

The function is partially visible, and the logic for generating the summary response and saving it is not yet complete. I will fetch the remaining lines to fully understand the function. The `summarize_commit` function is now fully visible. Here's the complete process:

1. **Cache Check**: If a cached summary exists for the commit, it is returned immediately.
2. **Temporary Files**: Creates temporary files for storing:
   - Commit history (`hist`).
   - Summary prompt (`pr`).
   - Generated summary (`res_file`).
3. **History and Version Info**:
   - `build_history` generates the commit history.
   - `find_version_file` and `get_version_info` retrieve version information.
4. **Prompt Construction**: Builds a summary prompt using `build_prompt` and a template file.
5. **Response Generation**:
   - Calls `generate_response` to generate the summary based on the prompt.
   - Appends commit metadata and the generated summary to `res_file`.
6. **Cache and Output**:
   - Saves the summary to the cache (if applicable).
   - Outputs the summary.

With this understanding, I can now proceed to modularize `summarize_target` and `summarize_commit` and provide a detailed implementation plan for version 0.4.0.
### Implementation Plan for Modularizing `summarize_target` and `summarize_commit`

#### Goals
1. **Improve Code Reusability**: Break down large functions into smaller, reusable components.
2. **Enhance Readability**: Simplify the logic for easier understanding and maintenance.
3. **Facilitate Testing**: Enable unit testing of individual components.

---

#### Modularization Plan

1. **`summarize_target`**:
   - **Current State**: Handles multiple target types (`--current`, `--cached`, commit ranges, single commits) with conditional logic.
   - **Proposed Changes**:
     - Extract logic for each target type into separate functions:
       - `process_special_target()`
       - `process_commit_range()`
       - `process_single_commit()`
     - Refactor `summarize_target` to delegate tasks to these functions.

2. **`summarize_commit`**:
   - **Current State**: Combines history building, prompt generation, and response handling in a single function.
   - **Proposed Changes**:
     - Create helper functions:
       - `generate_commit_history()`: Encapsulates `build_history` logic.
       - `build_commit_summary_prompt()`: Encapsulates `build_prompt` logic.
       - `generate_summary_response()`: Encapsulates `generate_response` logic.
     - Refactor `summarize_commit` to use these helper functions.

---

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Helper Functions**:
   - Implement `process_special_target`, `process_commit_range`, and `process_single_commit` for `summarize_target`.
   - Implement `generate_commit_history`, `build_commit_summary_prompt`, and `generate_summary_response` for `summarize_commit`.

2. **Refactor Main Functions**:
   - Update `summarize_target` to delegate tasks to the new helper functions.
   - Update `summarize_commit` to use the new helper functions.

3. **Update Tests**:
   - Add unit tests for each new helper function.
   - Update existing tests for `summarize_target` and `summarize_commit` to ensure compatibility.

4. **Validate Changes**:
   - Run all tests to confirm functionality.
   - Perform manual testing for edge cases.

   - Extract logic for handling commit ranges (`..`, `...`) into `handle_commit_range()`.
   - Extract logic for single commits into `handle_single_commit()`.

2. **Refactor `summarize_commit()`**:
   - Separate the logic for building history, version info, and prompt into helper functions:
     - `build_history()`
     - `find_version_file()`
     - `get_version_info()`
     - `build_prompt()`
   - Ensure proper error handling for invalid commits or empty diffs.

3. **Update Tests**:
   - Add unit tests for each helper function.
   - Ensure existing tests for `summarize_target()` and `summarize_commit()` still pass.

**Code References:**
- history.sh (lines 186–352)

**Steps:**
1. **Implement Detection Logic**:
   - Add a new function `detect_project_type()` in config.sh.
   - Use `find` or `ls` to locate common version files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.).
   - Allow users to specify custom version files via CLI.

2. **Integrate with `parse_args()`**:
   - Add a `--project-type` flag to args.sh.
   - Pass the detected project type to downstream functions.

3. **Update Tests**:
   - Add tests for `--project-type` in `test_parse_args.bats`.

**Code References:**
- config.sh
- args.sh
- test_parse_args.bats

---

#### **4. Inject Git Metadata**
- **Objective:** Include `git config user.name` and a date token in summaries.

**Steps:**
1. **Retrieve Git Metadata**:
   - Add a function `get_git_metadata()` in system.sh to fetch `git config user.name`.

2. **Inject Metadata into Summaries**:
   - Update `summarize_commit()` to include `user.name` and the current date in the generated summary.

3. **Update Tests**:
   - Add tests to verify that `user.name` and date are correctly included in summaries.

**Code References:**
- system.sh
- history.sh
- summarize_target.bats
