## Overview
The changes primarily focus on improving debugging, logging, and code readability throughout the script. Debug messages are now centralized and toggleable based on a debug mode variable, which has been renamed for consistency. Logging throughout the script has been cleaned up by removing redundant statements and ensuring consistent debug output. These updates enhance maintainability, facilitate troubleshooting, and improve overall code clarity without affecting core functionalities.

### Fixed
- Centralized debug message display logic in `src/helpers.sh` (lines 50, 185, 194, 273, 422, 852) to rely on a single `$dug` check, reducing redundancy.
- Removed multiple separate debug condition checks scattered across `src/giv.sh`, ensuring all debug messages are controlled consistently by the `$dug` variable.
- Fixed inconsistent debug output conditions by checking if `$dug` equals `"true"` rather than relying on the presence of a non-empty string or other conditions, standardizing behavior.
- Corrected the debug check condition in `cmd_message()` to be `if [ "$dug" = "true" ]; then` for uniformity.
- Enhanced the readability of log messages with clear, consistent prefixes and formatting, ensuring debug logs are easily distinguishable.
- Removed duplicate or unnecessary debug statements that did not add value, cleaning up clutter throughout the script.

### Style
- Updated all debug and log print functions (`print_dug`, `print_warn`, etc.) to use a uniform check against `$dug` for clarity and consistency.
- Standardized the condition for printing debug messages to `[ "$dug" = "true" ]` across all scripts (`src/giv.sh`, `src/helpers.sh`) to improve readability and maintainability.
- Refactored conditionals to reduce nesting and improve clarity when enabling verbose/debug mode.
- Used consistent indentation and formatting in the inline debug condition checks for better visual parsing of code.

### Chores
- Removed redundant debug condition checks throughout the codebase, streamlining the debugging logic.
- Cleaned up logging statements to ensure a consistent debug output format, aiding debugging and log analysis.
- Organized debug-related code into a single, reusable function `print_dug()` in `src/helpers.sh` for centralized control.
- Ensured all debug messages are controlled solely by the `$dug` variable, simplifying toggle management.

These updates optimize the script's logging mechanism, making debugging easier and the codebase cleaner, with minimal impact on existing functionalities.

## Change Log Summary

### Fixed
- Resolved issue with missing configuration files by adding a check in `parse_args` that ensures warnings are only issued when the config file is not the default `.env` (src/giv.sh: lines 157-157).  
- Updated tests to reflect new warning messages with proper formatting, changing from "Warning" to "WARNING" and including consistent quoting (tests/test_parse_args.ats: lines 144, 246).  
- Corrected variable handling for boolean flags like `debug` and `dry_run` by assigning string values ("true" instead of true), ensuring proper string comparison in scripts (src/giv.sh: lines 157-157, tests/tests.ats: lines 23, 185).
