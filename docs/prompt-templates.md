# How to Create Prompt Templates for the `giv` CLI

This guide explains how to build and use prompt templates for `giv` subcommands. Prompt templates let you customize the text `giv` generates—such as summaries, commit messages, and announcements—by inserting dynamic tokens that get replaced at runtime.

---

## 1. Why Use Prompt Templates?

* **Consistency:** Ensure all outputs follow your project’s style and guidelines.
* **Customization:** Tailor messages for different audiences or subcommands.
* **Reusability:** Define common structures once and reuse across multiple commands.

## 2. Available Tokens

Use these tokens in your templates; `giv` replaces them with actual values when running a command.

| Token             | Description                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[SUMMARY]`       | A summary of the code changes or content.                 |
| `[PROJECT_TITLE]` | The name or title of your project.                        |
| `[VERSION]`       | The current version number (e.g., `v1.2.3`).              |
| `[RULES]`         | Any rules or guidelines for content generation.           |
| `[EXAMPLE]`       | An illustrative example or sample output (if applicable). |

## 3. Template File Location

By convention, store your templates in the `.giv/templates/` folder in your project root:

```
.giv/
├── templates/
│   ├── summary.md
│   ├── announcement.md
│   └── message.md
├── src/
```

Files should be named to match the corresponding `giv` subcommand (for example, `summary.md` for `giv summary`).

## 4. Creating a New Template

Follow these steps to create or customize a prompt template:

1. **Choose Subcommand:** Decide which `giv` subcommand (e.g., `summary`, `announcement`) you’ll target.
2. **Copy or Create File:** In `templates/`, create a new file named `<subcommand>_prompt.md`, or copy an existing template from the `templates/` directory of this repository.
3. **Insert Tokens:** Open the file and place tokens where dynamic content should appear. Use headers, paragraphs, or lists for structure.
4. **Save & Reference:** Save the file. When running `giv`, use the `--prompt-file` option to point to your template:

   ```sh
   giv summary --prompt-file=templates/summary_custom.md
   ```
5. **Test & Iterate:** Review the generated output, tweak your template, and retest until satisfied.

## 5. Example: Custom Summary Template

Below is a sample `templates/summary.md` for the `giv summary` subcommand. Copy and adapt it as needed:

```markdown
# Project: [PROJECT_TITLE]

**Version:** [VERSION]

---

## Change Summary

[SUMMARY]

---

### Guidelines

[RULES]

---

#### Sample Output

[EXAMPLE]
```

**How it works:**

* The first heading shows the project title and version.
* The `Change Summary` section displays the dynamic summary.
* `Guidelines` remind users of any style or formatting rules.
* `Sample Output` gives a concrete example of how the final text looks.

---

## 6. Best Practices

* **Keep It Simple:** Avoid overly complex templates; focus on clarity.
* **Use Comments:** Add Markdown comments (`<!-- comment -->`) to remind future editors of token purposes.
* **Version Control:** Commit your templates alongside code to track changes..

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

* **Token Not Replaced?** Verify the token matches exactly (including brackets).
* **File Not Found?** Check the path and filename given to `--prompt-file`.
* **Unexpected Output?** Run with `DEBUG=1` or consult `giv --help` for verbose logging.

---

## Conclusion

Prompt templates give you control over the language and format of text generated by `giv`. By defining clear structures and using tokens wisely, you can produce consistent, professional output across all your projects.
